# PS4-Data-Exploration
M13-15: Final Assignment (PS4) - Data Exploration

This project takes a very shallow exploration into the data behind The Pew Research Center's Religious Landscape Study (LDS). 
The data on which I based my analysis comes from the public use file- a version of the raw data that excludes several sensitive variables that could be used to compromise participant anonymity. 

This public use file is too large for GitHub. For replication, you can use the clean and filtered RSL.sav data, or download the original by following the DOI in the citation:
Pew Research Center. 2025. “2023-24 U.S. Religious Landscape Study Dataset – Public Use File.” doi: 10.58094/3kwb-bf52.
